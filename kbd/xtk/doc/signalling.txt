XT keyboard protocol and signalling
===================================

The keyboard comnmunicates with the PC/XT through a mostly single-direction
serial link.

When the link is idle, the CLK line is high (floating), and the DATA line is
low (pulled by the keyboard).

When the keyboard wants to send a byte:
- It checks that the CLK line is not pulled low (the PC/XT does this when the
receiving buffer is full).
- It sends the byte for the keycode. There is a start bit (DATA=1), followed by
the 7-bit keycode (LSb first), and the make/break bit (set for release, clear
for key press).

As the 9th bit is pushed, the PC will force the clock line low until the CPU has
read the received byte and cleared the receiving register.

The PC stores the data on the falling edge of the clock. It can also reset the
keyboard by pulling the clock line low for too long (unsure what the exact
timing is).

It is up to the keyboard to manage the states of the LEDs. At power on, the LEDs
are off. They are switched by pressing CAPS and NUM locks. It's possible that
they get out of sync with the caps/num state the computer has. It is also up to
the keyboard to handle typematic (key repeat) and a keyboard buffer, if needed.

At boot, the keyboard is supposed to send 0xAA when it is ready to work.
However, I'm not sure my XT clone BIOS actually checks for that.
