XTK: Hardware description
=========================

Nothing too fancy here. We run an ATMega48P (but any other AVR chip would do)
on a 16MHz crystal (not really needed, but it was there on the prototyping
board).

The PS/2 keyboard interface is handled by my ps/2 keyboard library, see there
for more information.

The XT is connected using a DIN connector on the keyboard port. We get our
power supply from there (and also power the keyboard). The clock signal is
wired on PB2 and the data line on PB1. A debug led is available on PD6, but
this will probably be removed once everything is working as expected.

Later on I will probably move to an ATTiny2313 (because I have one available)
or some chip with an even lower pin count. This will allow making the interface
smaller. Ideally it would be roughly the size of the DIN connector and could be
fitted there.
